	<h1>What Is This?</h1>
	<p>In the clan I am in in Clash Royale, people constantly ask what the chances are they they have, or havent recieved a legendary card yet. Over time I myself got bored of calculating this by hand and soon made a program that would do it, but the problem was that the program was only accessable to me. Now you can easily find the probability of a legendary in a single chestbut what this deals with is the probability in multiple chests and can even handle the probability of it containing multiple legendaries.</p>
